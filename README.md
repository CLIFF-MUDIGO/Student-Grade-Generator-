# Name of the Project
Student Grade Generator
### CLIFF MUDIGO : 17.2023
## Project Description
The Student Grade Generator is a toy problem that demonstrates how programming concepts can be used to solve real-world problems. This program prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100, and then uses a set of criteria to assign a corresponding grade. The grades are then displayed to the user in a visually appealing format. This toy problem is a great way to practice working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it can be expanded upon to create more complex grading systems or other types of applications.
